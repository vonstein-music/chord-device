Authentic cadence is achieved when the dominant seventh is resolved to the tonic (for example: G7 to CMA). The tonality of a dominant seventh is somewhat dissonant and unresolved when played as the V resolving to the I, but is frequently used as the I particularly in Funk and Blues styles. Blues players regularly substitute majors for dominant sevenths, for example: a I-IV-V progression in the key of G would normally be GMA, CMA and D7, Blues players may change this to G7, C7 and D7.',
